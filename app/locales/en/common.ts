  "GOSPEL.LOW2.DESC":
    "Often, we don't feel God's love because we ignore Him. We all seek meaning and fulfillment in life, but not with God. We don't trust Him. We don't follow His will for us. When we live our lives our own way, the Bible calls it sin. Sin damages our relationships and negatively impacts our interactions with others. Sin separates us from the life God intended for us.",

  "GOSPEL.LOW3.DESC":
    "Our sin does not prevent God from loving us. In fact, He came to earth in human form as Jesus Christ to die for us. On the cross, Jesus took the punishment for our sins. Jesus died, but He rose again. He reconciled us to God. Through faith, we can know God's love and receive eternal life.",

We can ask God for forgiveness for living our lives our own way and make the decision to live for God, trusting in Christ. What will your choice be?",
